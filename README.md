# UNETR 2D Tensorflowï¼†Keras
An unofficial Tensorflow(Keras) implementation of UNETR for 2D medical image segmentation.

This is one of my early work, just as an example. I cannot guarantee that the network details are exactly the same as the original paper. Everyone is welcome to improve this code. Really hope that the Tensorflow community will have more SOTA medical image segmentation architectures.
